# Malicious-URL-Classification

The following project is in the context of obtaining my phd, I propose an Active Learning approach to classify if the url is malicious or not.

The resolution of the problem undergoes 3 key steps:

- Data Preprocessing / Feature Engineering: where we clean the data and build new features from the original url.
- Building Machine Learning Models using Lexical Features.
- Set up active learning.

Associate with this project, I am currently working on a paper in order to publish it.
